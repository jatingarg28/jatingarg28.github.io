<h1>Our History</h1>
<h2>National Basketball Association (NBA)</h2>
<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of 
America. It adopted the name National Basketball Association in the fall of 1949 after adding several
 teams from the rival National Basketball League (NBL).</p>
 <h2>National Basketball League (NBL)</h2>
 <p>The National Basketball League (NBL) is one of the original leagues prior to the NBA. The 
 National Basketball League was a professional basketball league in the United States from 1937 to 
 1949. The NBL started with 13 previously independent teams in 1937-38. The league was created by 
 three corporations General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear. The league was made up mostly by teams 
 in small Great Lakes towns and corporate teams. The NBL lasted 12 years before merging with the 
 three-year-old Basketball Association of America in 1949 which was renamed the National Basketball 
 Association.</p>

decline. Iin 1976 only 5 teams remained. Four of those teams, the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, 
New York Nets, and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA, while the fifth team the Spirt of St. Louis did 
not.</p>
